This function makes a c project:
void create_project_c(const char *project_name, const char *project_description, const char *project_author, const char *project_license, const char *project_version,const char *project_dependencies, const char *generate_readme,const char *initialize_git, const char *create_license_file,const char *generate_structure)
{
    
}

Heres what must happen
A c file, called main.c, must be created in the current dir, with code inside that prints "Hello from CodeStarter"
It must all so have comments at the top, that say
File: main.c
Author: <project_author>
License: <project_license>
Version: <project_version>
Description: <project_description>

Then, if generate_readme == yes, it must make a reamde that says # <project_name> "NEWLINE" description "NEWLINE" "NEWLINE" # Installation "NEWLINE" "NEWLINE" # Usage "NEWLINE" "NEWLINE" # License "NEWLINE" "NEWLINE" # Credits "NEWLINE" "NEWLINE" # Contact "NEWLINE" "NEWLINE" # Acknowledgments
That part must have nice formatting
if initialize_git == yes, it must initialize git, and add all the files, and commit them with the message "Initial commit"
if git not installed, provide link to git download
if create_license_file == yes, it must create a license file, with the license type provided
if generate_structure == yes, it must create a structure for the project, "src","build","include","tests","docs","examples","scripts","data"
for c, it must create a makefile, with the following commands:
all:
build:
run:
clean:
.PHONY
It must use the best practice and it must use good warnings. 
The location where to find the src files, where to put them, and stuff liek that must go in a seperate config file,
a .gitirgnore file must be created(if git is setup) and must ignore the approite files
Finally, a project.json file must be made in the aprite format, with prject name,version,desaction,aoutjer and whatver else
